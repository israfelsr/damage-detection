# Damage Detection

This projects uses machine learning algorithms to identify the damage in a
composite material. The objective is to input the damage index image and obtain 
a segmentation of the damage region.
For this, we will train different classifiers using image segmentation techniques.

## Data
The image below shows some pairs (damage_index, damage_region). We will use this
to train in a supervised manner.

## Getting Started
The jupyter notebook file `knn.ipynb` goes over the implementation of a k-nearest
neigbourhs algorithm. We can see some results in the image below.
